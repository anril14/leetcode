Category,Name,Solution
Array,1. Two Sum,Using hashmap with already been seen values and if difference between target value and current element has already been seen returns positions of both this numbers
Linked list,2. Add Two Numbers,"Just simply adding up values of equal by number node elements, and use shortif statement for edge cases, return next element of new linked list right after dummy node"
String,9. Palindrome Number,Compare first and reversed second half of string by dividing them without a trace
String,14. Longest Common Prefix,First of all sort all strings by number of elements and add symbols to new string if every string contains it on this position
Stack,20. Valid Parentheses,Add parenthesis to stack if it opens and remove if last element fits exit par. If stack is empty output is true
Linked list,21. Merge Two Sorted Lists,Choose between best value and add it to new linked list then move pointer of one of the lowest value list to next
Array,26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array,"If prev element doesn't match actual we incrementing our magic j pointer that counting all duplicates and also pointing at ""actual"" array position"
Array,27. Remove Element,Use new list to store suitable variables and then assign values from new list to a given array
Binary search,35. Search Insert Position,Simple binary search with else expression
Linked list,141. Linked List Cycle,Two pointers: slow and fast and if linked list is not cycled they would never met each other
Stack,155. Min Stack,Use additional stack for minimal values and some default stack operations
Linked list,206. Reverse Linked List,Two pointers or recursion
Queue,225. Implement Stack using Queues,Just use collections.deque library
Recursion,509. Fibonacci Number,Simple two-branch recursion
Stack,682. Baseball Game,"Match, case for symbols In array and stack-like opertaions to array elements"
Linked list,707. Design Linked List,Using two dummy nodes from each side for convenience and just some logic for every method
Array,1470. Shuffle the Array,Create new array and append firstly I element then I+n element
Linked list,1472. Design Browser History,Again two dummy nodes but now with one more current indicator
Array,1700. Number of Students Unable to Eat Lunch,"Calculate count of student preferences (It doesn't depend on the order) and then check match on every interation, if there is not match return sum of rest students"
Array,1929. Concatenation of Array,Create new array and append all items from two given arrays
Sorting,912. ÊSort an Array,Merge sorting
Sorting,75. Sort Colors,Bucket sorting
Dynamic programming,70. Climbing Stairs,"Recursive like fibonacci is too slow, so use dynamic programming (temporary memoization of values)"
Binary search,704. ÊBinary Search,Default binary search
Binary search,74. ÊSearch a 2D Matrix,Default binary search wrapped in cycle
Binary search,240. ÊSearch a 2D Matrix II,Absolutely identical solution as 74
